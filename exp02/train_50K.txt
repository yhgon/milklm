Buffer Index: 122, Total Tokens: 183675, Decoded Buffer: Life's history in iron
A new study examines how Earth's oldest iron formations could have been formed before oxygenic photosynthesis played a role in oxidizing iron.
Geology tells us a great deal about the history and evolution of life on our planet. By studying formations in the rock record, astrobiologists can uncover important clues about the history of habitability on Earth.
Of particular interest to astrobiologists are iron formations, which existed on Earth at key periods in the evolution ...

This morning Washington State was put on Tsunami watch after a 7.9 earthquake was monitored just off the Alaskan coast. You can view more about the warning here. While tsunamis are not likely to reach further inland, many of us enjoy heading to the beaches in the summertime for vacations and therefore knowing what to do during an earthquake and tsunami along the coastlines is a good idea.
Here are some downloadable facts about Tsunamis: http://nws.weather.gov/nth...
