Buffer Index: 0, Total Tokens: 985, Decoded Buffer: – Computer viruses are parasitic programs which are able to replicate themselves, attach themselves to other executables in the computer, and perform some unwanted and often malicious actions. A virus is not able to spread itself to another computers, some user actions are needed for it to infect a new computer. Downloading and running software from untrusted sources, inserting an USB drive without a previous scan–remember always disable the AutoRun feature for the drives as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs– ,...
/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/gguf/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/utils/checkpoint.py:464: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. In version 2.4 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.

Buffer Index: 7, Total Tokens: 349, Decoded Buffer: World's first 3D keyhole surgery performed at University of Surrey
28 Jan 2011
Doctors performed the world's first remote 3D keyhole surgery
during a symposium at the University of Surrey last December.
Keyhole surgery reduces the length of hospital stays and
post-operative complications. This also means that patients
experience less scarring and pain. 3D keyhole surgery is a
state-of-the-art extension of standard keyhole surgery that uses 3D
cameras like those used to make the film 'Avatar'. It...

Buffer Index: 9, Total Tokens: 107, Decoded Buffer: After the famous earthquake of 1755 that destroyed much of the city and could be felt all across the Mediterranean and much of continental Europe, the people of Lisbon had to rebuild the city. Portugal’s chief minister Sebastia Jose de Carvalho e Mello (1699 – 1782) was particularly influential in modernizing the old city. He conducted a survey among local priests to find out as much as possible about how people experienced the disaster. He also changed the layout of the city significantly.

The Orange-tip (Anthocharis cardamines) is a common and beautiful butterfly, typically emerging late March or early April. The males, with their bright orange colouration,
wander widely and, to many of us, herald the start of spring.
My recently updated digital atlas of the county's butterflies has revealed the patchy
distribution of this species in Montgomeryshire. This Spring, I need your help to better understand where this charismatic butterfly occurs in the county...
