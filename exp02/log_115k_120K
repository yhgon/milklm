Buffer created with 200 items
Buffer Index: 288, Total Tokens: 228695, Decoded Buffer: Induced angle of attack is technically a mathematical concept. You can't measure it directly via flow sensors [from an isolated wing]. However, it is extremely useful in understanding and predicting the production of induced drag.
Just like Newton's theory of gravity is a mathematical abstraction; but, if it helps you in understanding and predicting outcomes, you might as well accept it as real. Read the following subsections if you want to understand the potential flow aerodynamic modeling a bi...

Your Weimaraner doesn’t have the same digestive system as you do, so it’s important to know which human foods are safe for your furry friend. Below are the most common fruits, vegetables & other snacks Weimaraners can (and can’t) eat.
